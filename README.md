# Eye Controlled Mouse Using MediaPipe and PyAutoGUI

This project demonstrates how to control the mouse pointer using eye movements detected by the webcam. The project uses the following libraries:

- `OpenCV` for capturing webcam frames.
- `MediaPipe` for facial landmark detection (specifically, the Eye Region).
- `PyAutoGUI` for controlling the mouse pointer.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
